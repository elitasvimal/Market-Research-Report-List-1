<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Metal Ventilation Fan market is primarily segmented into two types: Axial and Centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, making them suitable for applications requiring high airflow at low pressure, such as exhaust and general ventilation. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, draw air into the fan inlet and exhaust it at a 90-degree angle, generating higher pressures, making them ideal for industrial applications and systems needing increased airflow resistance. Both types serve distinct purposes in ventilation systems.</p></p>
