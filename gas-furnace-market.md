<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage Gas Furnaces</li><li>Two-stage Gas Furnaces</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas furnace market comprises primarily two types: single-stage and two-stage gas furnaces. Single-stage gas furnaces operate at a fixed heating capacity, turning on and off to maintain temperature, making them less energy-efficient. In contrast, two-stage gas furnaces adjust their output based on heating needs, operating at low or high capacity, which enhances comfort and efficiency. As homeowners increasingly prioritize energy savings and climate control, the demand for two-stage models is growing in the market.</p></p>
