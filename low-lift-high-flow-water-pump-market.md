<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-lift High-flow Water Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Axial Flow Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The low-lift, high-flow water pump market features primarily two types: centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational kinetic energy to move water, making them ideal for applications requiring moderate lift and high flow rates. In contrast, axial flow pumps utilize a propeller-like mechanism to push water in a linear motion, excelling in transporting large volumes of water at low heads. Both types cater to diverse industries, including agriculture, irrigation, and water management, due to their efficiency and reliability.</p></p>
