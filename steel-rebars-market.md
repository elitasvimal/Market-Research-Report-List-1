<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steel rebar market includes deformed and mild steel types. Deformed steel rebars feature ridges or patterns for enhanced bonding with concrete, making them ideal for reinforced structures requiring high tensile strength. Mild steel rebars, smooth and without deformations, are used in applications where flexibility and ease of shaping are prioritized, though they offer lower tensile strength. Both types cater to construction needs, with deformed rebars dominating structural projects and mild steel used in lighter, less demanding applications.</p></p>
